 Exercise 1: Charlie bit my finger! (after lecture 3)
Part 1: Charlie will bite your finger exactly 50% of the time. First, write a function
isBitten() that returns TRUE with 50% probability, and FALSE otherwise.
Hint: You may find the rand() function useful.
Part 2: Below the function, write code to generate a webpage that displays “Charlie bit your
finger!” or “Charlie did not bite your finger!” using the isBitten() function
